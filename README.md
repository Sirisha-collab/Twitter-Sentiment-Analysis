**Twitter Sentiment Analysis with NLP & Big Data**

This repository contains projects for analyzing Twitter text using NLP, ML, and Big Data concepts.

 1. LLM_Sentiment.ipynb – Sentiment analysis using large language models with visualizations.

 2. Twitter Analysis.ipynb – Basic Twitter text preprocessing and feature extraction.

 3. Twitter_Analysis_with_ML.ipynb – TF-IDF vectorization and ML model comparison (Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes).

 4. Twitter_Analysis_with_NLP_and_Big_Data.ipynb – Full pipeline: Big Data processing, streaming analysis, NLP, and sentiment modeling.

-Implements TF-IDF, word frequency analysis, streaming windows, and MapReduce-style processing.
-Visualizations include model accuracy comparison and top frequent words in tweets.
-Supports both small datasets and simulated Big Data workflows for scalability testing.
-Aims to provide an end-to-end pipeline for Twitter sentiment insights.
